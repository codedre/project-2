## Project Workflow

**Does not meet expectations**

If you're wondering why you didn't get where you expected, I'd put some money on this area.  No readme, no stories, no planning folder?  I think I smell a thrash coming.

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

At first glance of the code, I felt it exceeded expectations.  Upon further investigation, I realized that only a single route was used: "home#search", which didn't use any of the models.  There's an awful lot of unused code here.


## Creativity / Interface

**Meets expectations**

Clean and crisp, but some of the information is duplicated and its purpose is unclear.

## Code Quality

**Does not meet Expectations**

Looks like mostly scaffolded code. I see evidence of effort for authentication, but it's not actually used.  The search code sounds impressive, until you see it's one line of code.  Good job on the PORO model.  Nice and clean.

## Deployment and Functionality

**Does not meet expectations**

My first request worked, but "Search" gave an error and no food searches worked after that, even from the root route.  You are capable of so much more.  What happened?
